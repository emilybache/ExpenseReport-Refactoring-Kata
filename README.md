# ExpenseReport Refactoring Kata

![License: CC-BY-SA](by-sa.svg)
The ExpenseReport legacy code refactoring kata in various languages.

This is an example of a piece of legacy code with lots of code smells.
The goal is to support the following new feature:
* Add Lunch with an expense limit of 2000.


## Credits
I forked this code from [Christian Hujer](https://github.com/christianhujer/expensereport)
He first encountered the ExpenseReport example during a bootcamp at Equal Experts.
He has also seen the ExpenseReport example being used by Robert C. Martin.
If you know who has first come up with this example, please get in touch.

# ExpenseReport Refactoring Kata

![License: CC-BY-SA](by-sa.svg)
The ExpenseReport legacy code refactoring kata in various languages.

This is an example of a piece of legacy code with lots of code smells.
The goal is to support the following new feature:
* Add Lunch with an expense limit of 2000.

## Alterations by Emily Bache
Not all the language versions have the same starting position. I have updated some of them with a suitable regression test you can lean on while refactoring.
Language versions including this test:

* Java


## Credits
I forked this code from [Christian Hujer](https://github.com/christianhujer/expensereport)
He first encountered the ExpenseReport example during a bootcamp at Equal Experts.
He has also seen the ExpenseReport example being used by Robert C. Martin.
If you know who has first come up with this example, please get in touch.
